## Git practices

* each feature is developed in a separate branch

* master must always be in a functional state
  * if master is broken, fixing it becomes the highest priority

* smaller adjustments, which don't belong to current user story branches, should be done in dev-branch and merged when possible, see above

* if a feature is done, it should be merged and its branch should be deleted

* commits in English
